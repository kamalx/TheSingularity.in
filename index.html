The Singularity is happening on an open piece of land near the Bangalore
airport just north of the city.  It is a festival of learning, and enacting the
future. It is a place where we live in the future and see what is missing. 
<p>
We cos-play a rural cyber scenario with electric unicycles, high speed
internet, cheap smart phones, solar power, lithium batteries, powerful personal
speakers, autonomous drones, chatbots, and the gig economy.
<p>
Here androids are common place, everything is electric, we are built it
yourself confident.
<p>
Come. Camp with us. Take an online class. Work on your startup idea. Work on an
open source project. Make Art. Do Yoga. Meditate.  Have Fun. Celebrate.
<p>
This is a camping festival. We create the structures we want to live in and
work in. People learn online, work online, play online, and also work in the
physical world
<p>
A festival pass costs 10,000 Inr. which entitles access to the space for a 3
month season.  They can pitch a tent or build a temporary structure.  Tentâ€™s
need to be taken down if not occupied for awhile. Structures are generally
taken down and rebuilt each quarter. 
<p>
Different communities set up camps. Jaaga sets up camps for coworking and
colearning.  Startups, Special Interest Groups, and just groups of friends set
up camps together.
